GardenGate on Linux has a slightly different setup than on Windows. 

# Prerequisites
You must have:
- [A copy of PvZ GW2 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1922560/Plants_vs_Zombies_Garden_Warfare_2_Deluxe_Edition/)
- [maniman303's fork of FrostyModManager](https://github.com/maniman303/FrostyToolsuite/releases/tag/v1.0.6.3.v)
- [dinput8.dll](https://github.com/nocss42/GardenGate/releases) (from GardenGate releases)
- [Protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) ([Flatpak](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks) version also works)
- [Delta Patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases), and the [XDelta patch](https://github.com/nocss42/GardenGate/raw/refs/heads/main/Launcher/GW2_NO_EAAC.xdelta)

# Setup
- Install Garden Warfare 2
- Open the game once, proceed with EA App installation.
  - When finished, you should see an error that looks like [this](https://github.com/Rosiiiie/GardenGate/blob/main/docs/Assets/abFcugM.png?raw=true). This is intentional.
- Locate your game's install folder.
- Rename these files:
  - EAAntiCheat.GameServiceLauncher.exe

need to finish later
