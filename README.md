------
This is simply adding GW1 (potentially GW2) dedicated server support.

* Offsets changed to GW1's (some of them are rough)
* Server joining menu
* Kyber Proxy removed due to issues.
* NAT Punch-Through system
* In-Game server browser (when this works lol)
* Per-player team swapping
* Player kicking/moderation (maybe not possible, can't find the offsets)

What isn't done:
* Lmao like, everything else

Due to security reasons, i'd reccomend keeping multiplayer servers on LAN over things like RadminVPN if things work.
